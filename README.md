# GOVERNMENT NETWORK OPTIMIZATION
---
A Proposed Network Topology for the Government's Infrastructure Using Cisco Network Systems.

## SITUATIONAL PROBLEM

Government agencies have independent databases that makes the registration process lengthy and redundant.


## OBJECTIVES

The intention of this simulation is to implement the concepts, commands, and methods that were learned in the course Routing and Switching Essentials to build a proposed network design for our design through packet tracer and using Cisco Network Academy Laboratory Equipment.

The specific objectives are as follows:
-	To apply concepts in switching such as port security.
-	To apply concepts in routing both static and dynamic. 
-	To provide remote access using SSH. 
-	To apply dynamic host control protocol (DHCP).
-	To restrict certain networks using access lists (ACL).
